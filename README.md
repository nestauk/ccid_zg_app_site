# Zeitgeist

Zeitgeist is a tool to run deliberative workshops created by the [Centre for Collective Intelligence](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/centre-collective-intelligence-design/), at [Nesta](https://nesta.org.uk).

We'd be glad to arrange a demonstration for you.

Please contact: collective.intelligence@nesta.org.uk

## Get ready to participate

We're looking forward to seeing you on your scheduled Zeitgeist video call workshop. Ahead of time, please [check your readiness](https://demo.zg-app.com/check/) to make sure everything's working for you...

## What is Zeitgeist?

Zeitgeist integrates the entire deliberation process into one platform, combining qualitative insights from group discussions with robust quantitative data to measure how individual and group views evolve during the conversation through various deliberative polling question types. Below is a more detailed description of the Zeitgeist and its features for this experience...

### Facilitation Tools

* Facilitators use Zeitgeist’s interface to access everything required to run deliberations.
* The platform provides real-time polling results, facilitation guides, video call software and drivable workshop content so the facilitator only needs one tool and no notes.
* Sessions can be held either in person on CCI provided tablets or remotely through video conferencing on personal devices.

### Quantitative data

Zeitgeist tracks participant quantitative responses through various polling formats:

* Multiple-choice and closed choice questions
* Likert-scale responses (e.g., "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree")
* Points allocations question
* Up and downvote
* Wikitext
* Open-ended text fields for qualitative feedback

### Stimulus

* Zeitgeist hosts stimuli directly on the platform. This can include video, infographics or text.
* For the Situation Room we used short “Newscasts from the Future” — scenario-based videos that portrayed the future impacts of climate measures participants were voting on.
* It enhances participants' understanding and ability to contribute through creative, educational content added into the platform.

### Outcome Analysis

* Zeitgeist aggregates and displays polling inputs in real time, providing immediate feedback to participants and facilitators to help facilitate discussion.
* On completion of a workshop or set of workshops all aggregated, anonymised data can be downloaded from the platform for further analysis.
