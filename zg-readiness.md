# Zeitgeist readiness

We're looking forward to seeing you on your scheduled Zeitgeist video call workshop. Ahead of time, here's how you can check to make sure you'll have a great experience...

## Supported devices

We currently support laptops and tablets with an internet connection and one of the main internet browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.

> ### ℹ️ TIP
> If you're not sure which browser you have, you almost certainly have one of these!

We expect that you're probably using Windows or Mac OS if you're on a laptop, and Android or iOS if you're on a tablet or iPad. If you're using Linux, we don't anticipate any issues and we'd love to hear from you.

## Video calls

**Are you ready to join a video call workshop on Zeitgeist?**

To join our video calls, you'll need a video camera and microphone. Most laptops and tablets have these already, but you can also use cameras or headsets connected to your device by USB cable or bluetooth.

Please visit the [Chime Readiness Checker](https://app.chime.aws/check) to confirm that you're able to connect.
